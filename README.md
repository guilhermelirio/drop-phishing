# drop-phishing
It's an example of how to drop a phishing site

Easier than making a website with phishing, is to fill it with fake data.
This is an example.

I just see to Network tab on Google Chrome Developer Tools, and:

    - Click with the left mouse button over request
    - Over copy, select "copy as cURL (bash)"
    - Start playing
